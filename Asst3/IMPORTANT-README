This project utilized a tar library: libtar

We were supposed to use the libtar.1.2.11.so inside iLab, however, such library has memory leaks problems and cannot be used.
Per Francisco's instruction, we downloaded libtar-1.2.11 source code from the following git repository:
    https://repo.or.cz/libtar.git

And made our patches on top of the tag/v1.2.11 inside the libtar git tree.
    Main changes:
        * fixes various memory leaks bugs
        * added support for big files that are over 4G
        * made the code ready to compile under iLab machine (config.h and listhash source codes are generated based on the
        original ./configure tool using iLab machine.

Because we cannot find the original LICENSE of libtar, we presume it is released under GPL license. The code changes that we
have made on top of libtar-1.2.11 is available in "libtar.patch" file, we also made it to be open source to comply to GPL License:
    https://github.com/dzz007/libtar

Our makefile does not produce libtar library directory (neither dynamically linked .aso file nor statically linked .a file)
we compile source codes resides inside libtar directly and link into our executable.
